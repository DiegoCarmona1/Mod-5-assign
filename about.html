            <h2>Beginnings</h2>
            <p>In the beginning our company began with a small family farm. Our Founder, Diego Carmona, expanded upon the idea to slowly but surely increase their capability and versatility within the agricultural business sector</p>
            <p>After expanding their business influence to other sectors of the economic world, &copy;Carmona Family co. began to enforce their strength within the agriculture sector of their business.</p>
            <p>It was a grand undertaking that nearly brought the company under due to unfortunate incidents during the 2012 and 2014 years of service. Thankfully they were quickly handled and the issues brought to light many details of the process that needed to be addressed.</p>
            <p>Promptly, the company had made, bold decisions about production, and established a new processing norm that quickly increased efficiency and cleanliness in processing different harvest products.</p>

            <h2>Present Success</h2>
            <p>Currently we have of the most established and influential agricultural businesses within the country and have heavily participated in the reformation of common practice norms to bring about a more efficient and healthy process for the customers and workers.</p>
            <p> From reestablishing worker unions, integration of artificial processing equipment, and the new 'Upbringing' product that helped to establish the Carmona Family corporation as the Mega-Corporation that it now stands as.</p>
            <p>Our produce has received many accolades due to its quality, and lack of pesticides, growth enhancers, or any artificial implementation that could ruin the pristine of the natural crop and meat</p>
            <p>Most recently, we have begun to invest in buying, repairing, and reselling used or broken agricultural equipment in  order to better spread proper equipment for other farmers or individuals to care for their crops in a proper and affordable way.</p>

            <h2>In the end...</h2>
            <p>From humble, and rocky beginnings to our newly established success. We have seen the highs and lows and have grown from both. Leaving behind our unfortunate losses and failures and now sitting on the precipice of history as we continue to develop and grow.</p>
            <p>We provide our products and services for the betterment of our communities, our people, and our world as we continue alternative ways to limit pollution, excess waste, and drive agriculture deeper into the folds of the future.</p>

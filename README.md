# Week-5-assignment
Author: Diego Carmona
Purpose: In order to familiarize myself and improve further in web development and website design. I have created this false company site for agricultural products and services, although those kinds of sites I find myself short in knowledge of.
Secondary purpose: Another reason for the design of this project, is of course to continually increase m y own personal skills for later use in the future. The more varied the tool, the farther that tool can go.
Tertiary purpose: As to improve my understanding of CSS styling and methods and techniques, I created this clone of a previous project in order to effectively build off from it, making the process quicker, easier, and utilizing my resources effectively.
